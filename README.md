# QMSE-experiment

The code to review is part of a Tic-Tac-Toe Android application written in Java.
You will be provided with 3 classes at the core of the application: 
# Board.java
This class is responsible for managing the state of the tic tac toe board. You will find here logic dedicated to the game itself. Creation of the board, marking of the cells and detection of a player victory for example.
# Player.java
This class represents a player of the game.
# Cell.class
Represent a cell of the board which can be occupied by a Player.

You have been asked to perform a code review on those files, the time limit is 30 minutes. 
Take notes of issues, bad practice and other mistakes you might see in those classes and if you finished earlier than the 30 minutes mark, add the time to the review file. 
Depending on the group, you are in this task is to be performed individually or in pairs. 
If you are not yet aware of which category you fall into, contact us on Slack (Philippe or Jaime).
Send the results by email at : philippe.duval@student.put.poznan.pl
